It is not clear whether Signal and WhatsApp groups have been set up, but the links for the apps are below should you need to download them:

- [Signal](https://signal.org) – available on Mac, Windows, iOS and Android. This app is for those who don’t get the latest news from Facebook.
- [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/download) – connects to WhatsApp’s desktop platform. Facebook owns WhatsApp. Alternatively, you can download it on your smartphone.

According to [EMF Inspections](https://emfinspections.co.uk/living-right-near-a-pylon-in-the-uk-what-you-need-to-know/), a provider of EMF (electromagnetic field) surveys, they are:

>- Lower property prices.
>- Faster power restoration.
>- Proximity to renewable energy sources.

They hummed and they hawed, the huffed and they puffed, and this is all they could come up with. Had to work hard on that, then…

Of course, aside from these dubious benefits there is the fact that the government is offering affected householders £2500. The catch is that the sum is spread over 10 years and provided as a discount off your electricity bill (source: [Energy Advice Helpline](https://energyadvicehelpline.org/energy-bill-discounts-for-homes-near-pylons-what-you-need-to-know/)). So we will never see that money in our hands. Even if it were available as a lump sum, it would not be enough. Nothing would ever be enough.

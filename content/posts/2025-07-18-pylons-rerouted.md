From [Lincolnshire Today](https://lincolnshiretoday.net/mag/pylon-route-plans-updated-in-bid-to-ease-landscape-concerns/):

> The updated Grimsby to Walpole route will still span 87 miles (140 km), but now includes a 7 km section of lower-height pylons through the Lincolnshire Wolds, where the structures will be reduced from 50 metres to 40 metres tall.

That’s a small concession, I think you’ll find.

> In addition to the Grimsby–Walpole line, a second Lincolnshire project is being planned between Weston Marsh and East Leicestershire. That route will now feature two substations and use 50-metre pylons across 60km.

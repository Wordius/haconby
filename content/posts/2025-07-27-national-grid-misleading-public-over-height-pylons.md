In a bid to appease concerned home owners, National Grid has been found to be telling tall stories about the pylon heights planned for the Grimsby to Walpole part of the firm’s ‘Great Grid Upgrade’.

<span class="caption">National Grid’s original documentation for the Grimsby to Walpole pylon line</span>

The [original documentation](https://www.nationalgrid.com/document/561116/download#page32) – see above – for the 87-mile long Grimsby to Walpole line said pylon heights would be ‘typically around 50m in height’.

But if you look through the pylon heights planned a year later, not a single pylon is exactly 50 metres tall. Instead they measure 40+ (a minor concession for the Lincolnshire Wolds AONB), 50+, 60+, 70+ metres tall. There’s even a couple that are 110 metres high.

You should include this in your objection letters or emails to National Grid, which are due by 6 August.

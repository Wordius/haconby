I have been informed by Pam Re, one of the organisers of Lincolnshire Against Needless Destruction (LAND), that there are objection templates available for the following purposes from their website:

- Grimsby–Walpole
- Solar farms
- Data centres
- Weston Marsh to East Leicestershire (Haconby, Dunsby, Stainfield, etc. residents).

They are available from [LAND’s website](https://www.lincsland.co.uk/misc/template).

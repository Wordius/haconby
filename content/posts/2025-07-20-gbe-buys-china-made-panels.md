The [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1lj21pjn72o):

> The first schools in England to install what the government described as "Great British Energy solar panels" bought them from Chinese firms, the BBC has learned.
>
> The government said the scheme was "the first major project for Great British Energy - a company owned by the British people, for the British people".

But earlier this year…

> … the law was changed to ban GB Energy from investing in renewables if there is evidence of modern slavery in their production.

And: 

> A GB Energy spokesperson said the company would "lead the way in ethical supply chains" and insisted there was "no place for forced labour or unethical practices in the UK's energy transition".
>
> The spokesperson added: "That is why we are introducing a statutory duty on Great British Energy to prevent modern slavery in its supply chains, and reviewing supplier transparency and disclosure standards to ensure confidence in all public-facing renewable programmes.
>
> "All contracts issued under this schools and hospitals solar initiative complied with UK procurement rules, including extensive requirements under the Modern Slavery Act.
>
> "GBE will seek to uphold these requirements in its contracting arrangements and are actively engaging with international partners to raise the bar globally on solar supply chain accountability."

What is the point of having modern slavery rules if you, the government, can’t be trusted to adhere to them?

Below gives you some idea of how to object to National Grid’s plans.

## Write a letter of concern

Send your completed letter to National Grid. Remember to make all the points outlined below.

- The **deadline** for submissions is 6 August 2025.
- This can be an informal email, even simply a list of points:
    - loss of prime farmland
    - local knowledge of wildlife
    - weak, narrow roads unsuited to construction vehicles
    - endangered species (Great Crested newts, barn owls, bats, etc.)
    - the largest population of Fallow deer in the UK (Dunsby Woods)
    - migrating birds flying into the wires
    - effect on drainage
    - the documented dangers of EMF
    - As long as it is reasoned, not simply “I won't like it” or “It will spoil my view”.
- [Email it to National Grid](mailto:ContactWMEL@nationalgrid.com?subject=WMEL:%20Letter%20of%20concern), including your email and full postal address, post it to ‘Freepost WM TO EL’ (no stamp necessary) or respond online at [nationalgrid.com/WMEL](https://nationalgrid.com/WMEL). The link open a new email and insert National Grid’s email address in the ‘To’ section. Alternatively, National Grid’s email is ‘ContactWMEL@nationalgrid.com’, minus the apostrophes, if you prefer to cut and paste.

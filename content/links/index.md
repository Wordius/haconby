## Other useful links

- [Grimsby to Walpole](https://www.nationalgrid.com/the-great-grid-upgrade/grimsby-to-walpole) – if this is built, then Weston Marsh to East Leicestershire will be next on National Grid’s agenda. All we can hope is to have a say in the direction/route it takes.
- [Weston Marsh to East Leicestershire](https://nationalgrid.com/wmel) – opens the proposed Weston Marsh to East Leicestershire section of National Grid’s so-called ‘Great Grid Upgrade’. This is the section that affects **Haconby** and surrounding villages.
- [Viking Link](https://www.nationalgrid.com/national-grid-ventures/viking-link) – forms a continuous link between the UK and Denmark.

No legalese here. I am not a solicitor (read lawyer), nor am I involved in the legal profession in any other way. 

## Your data

I tried to avoid using any Javascript at all, but this site serves up one piece of JS from Piwik Pro. You can read more about their privacy policy over [here](https://help.piwik.pro/support/privacy/). All I want to know is roughly how many people look at this website and what did they use to access it, because that interests me.

There is nothing else. There are no secret police nor are there any spies lurking in the shadows, though you can never be too careful these days. 

## Web fonts

I use web fonts. All font files are served from this domain and there is no third party involved. If you have web fonts turned off, it does not load that stylesheet or the corresponding files, which should save you some bandwidth but not much. I think this site looks better with them, but you may see things differently.

## Email

Emails sent to me are kept private, but I may want to quote something you have written on occasion. If that happens, I’ll ask you. If you have emailed me about something you think I got wrong, I will ask if it’s okay to use your name to credit the correction.

I accept comments via email, and only email. There may be some delay in me responding, but that’s to be expected when I have other work to do. 

I take your privacy and confidentiality seriously.

See the [contact page](/contact) for how to send me an email.

Linked below are the original, as I found them, documents issued by National Grid for the Weston Marsh to East Leicestershire extension of the ‘Great Grid Upgrade’. These files have been downloaded from National Grid’s website and are linked here from this website. That way, if National Grid chooses to change them in any underhand way (see [the Post Office scandal](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68079300)), you will always have this website to refer to the documents as they were originally presented.

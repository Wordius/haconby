No to Pylons (Nopy) was set up to provide a source of news and information about the proposed plyons that affect Haconby and surrounding villages. Its aim is to help you oppose National Grid’s work on the Weston Marsh to East Leicestershire extension in particular, as it affects Haconby. This site also gives you access to files that you may use, such as the [Letter of Objection](/links), which is made available for download.

Unless you happen to be a fully paid-up member of the Pylon Appreciation Society, the letter gives you somewhere to start.

As well as having this main goal, Nopy will look at the wider aspects of plans for Lincolnshire, including wind farms and solar energy projects. 

## Facebook group

Haconby & Stainfield’s Pylon Action Group is in the process of being set up. You can join the group and find out what news they have on Facebook.

## “But I don’t like/have Facebook”…

For anyone who doesn’t ‘do Facebook’, there’s this site as well as a number of others, such as [Lincolnshire Against Needless Destruction (LAND)](https://www.lincsland.co.uk).

## Pronunciation

Say it as you see it: ‘Nopy’ as in ‘copy’, or ‘Nopy’ as in ‘no-pie’. Depends how hungry you’re feeling at the time.
